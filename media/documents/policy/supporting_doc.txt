# **Bureaucrat App - Supporting Document**  

## **1. Technical Description**  

### **Overview**  
Bureaucrat App is a document management system designed to simplify the storage, categorization, and retrieval of important documents. It provides users with a secure way to upload and organize their files while ensuring accessibility and ease of use.

### **How It Works**  
- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up and log in using a secure authentication system.  
- **Document Uploading:** Users can upload documents categorized under predefined types (e.g., Legal, Financial, Policy).  
- **Storage System:** Uploaded documents are stored in a structured way, categorized under respective folders.  
- **Dashboard:** Users can view their uploaded documents with metadata such as title, category, and upload date.  
- **Summarization:** The app provides document summarization functionality, making it easier to extract key information from files.  

### **Architecture**  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (for styling and responsiveness).  
- **Backend:** Django (Python) for handling user authentication, database interactions, and document processing.  
- **Database:** SQLite (development phase) with future plans to migrate to MySQL/PostgreSQL for scalability.  
- **Storage:** Django's FileField for managing media files.

## **2. Challenges Faced and Solutions**  

### **Challenge 1: Secure Storage of Sensitive Data**  
- **Problem:** The `.env` file containing sensitive information was initially visible in the GitHub repository.  
- **Solution:** Added the `.env` file to `.gitignore`, ensuring it remains hidden from public access.  

### **Challenge 2: Deployment Issues**  
- **Problem:** Hosting the app on a free platform while maintaining database integrity.  
- **Solution:** Explored platforms like Render and Railway for seamless deployment with database support.  

### **Challenge 3: File Upload Management**  
- **Problem:** Handling document uploads with proper categorization and access control.  
- **Solution:** Implemented Django's `FileField` with a dynamic path function to store documents based on their category.
